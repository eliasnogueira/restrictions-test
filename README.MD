# Restrictions test
This test project belongs to a set of projects listed bellow:

* [restrictions-client](https://github.com/eliasnogueira/restrictions-client)
* [test-parent](https://github.com/eliasnogueira/test-parent)

## What this project does?
This is the test project for the [credit-restriction-api](https://github.com/eliasnogueira/credit-restriction-api), so you need to run locally the API service to be able to run the tests.

The RestrictionsTest class uses the restrictions-client project as a dependency to hit the correct endpoints.
You can configure the credit-restrictions-api (if you changed it) in the api.properties file.
